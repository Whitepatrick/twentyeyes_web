  I'm almost certain the issue is a js file not being read properly,

  Hello there! Since moving over to digital ocean for my web/utility VMs I've had a few
  upgrades. I'm currently collecting and indexing all my system logs and apache logs on cthulhu (VM1).
  Hastur is the second VM which does most of the behind the scenes work and is also running my
  jenkins instance. Eventually I'll add in a section to query live site metrics from elasticsearch.

  In bigger news, I've got a working alpha version of my new and improved version of this page

%p
  One of my favorite developers left the company I work to persue a new job, good for him! He was one of the few people left who were passionate about changing the course of our tech team from relying on manual testing, and was supporting almost all of the test infrastructure on his own. I won't go in to great deal of said "test infrastructure" since it's not that much to speak of, but the most glaring issue was that no one would be supporting
  %a{:href => "https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo", :target => "_blank"} Bamboo
  with him leaving. I have worked with Bamboo a little bit before but I was always turned off by their shifty community of plugins (don't get me started), plus the license was about to expire for our Bamboo install. How fortuitous! I have been using
  %a{:href => "https://jenkins-ci.org/", :target => "_blank"} Jenkins
  for a while now so I saw this as my chance to get us to ditch Bamboo and start fresh with Jenkins. I was like a kid in a candy store after setting up the fresh install, grabbing every plugin I could imagine being remotely useful for us, or even if it wasn't that useful it would be interesting to look at. This Bamboo > Jenkins switch started about a month ago, and as of last week it looks like we're fully migrated over to Jenkins and even have the test pipeline looking better than it did before!
  %b Great success!
%p
  Besides all the fun of playing with shiny new toys, work has been getting somewhat trying. The senior QA engineer quit to persue a different job (good for him as well!) which left quality assurance in a very dubious state. This was basically a breaking point for me, I hadn't been incredibly satisfied with my job in the past few months due to an huge spike in manual testing and time for creating very basic pieces of an automated testing framework was thrown out the window. A pile of meetings and conversations later we've finally convinced management that the value of manual testing may seem better from a very narrow view, in the long run it will cost us in technical debt, and possibly more employee exits. So for now we've been aforded a little bit of extra time to work on it. It's a small victory in my opinion, allowing me time to work on getting our tech team some better tools to work with is a step in the right direction but, the entire tech team needs to commit to this not as a pet project but as a project vital to our company staying in the modern era of software development.

%h3 2/6/2015: Hound Search 2: Son of hound search, and other updates!
%p What a week.
%p
  First off, I added a very adorable little script to my post Jenkins web build
  that initiates a git pull for all of the repos that are searchable within hound. I tried to
  change the css but that turned out horribly so original css remains! Eventually I'm going to
  create a separate jenkins job for this and trigger a pull when any repo gets a commit to master.

  about it and he mentioned he may not have the time to work on it personally, but will definitely accept
  pull requests. I think I'm going to do it, the MUC library for XMPP4R doesn't seem
  %b THAT
  bad.

  Only a few very minor tweaks to Rundeck and I think I can shift in to only supporting the system and
  no longer actively adding or testing jobs. I'm sure that sooner or later there will be more tasks to add.

%p
  %b LESSONS LEARNED
%ul
  %li Have a plan! I really should have known this wasn't as simple as backing up my old config and system files. If I had taken the time to write down what I wanted, and the absolute minimum things required to get it running, things would have run a whole lot smoother.
  %li Don't be scared! I avoided this upgrade for a while because I was making too big of a deal about going dark for a little. The upgrade process is a process I've done several times on local machines, doing it on a remote server was no different at all
  %li Jenkins rule! I'm fortunate enough at work to be able to use Atlassian tools, but I think considering my past experiences with Jenkins, I've grown to be somewhat partial to it. Bamboo is a phenomenal tool, but I will always pick Jenkins given the choice between the two.
  %li Whoa, Docker.. My original plan was to drop a few containers on here to see exactly how portable thye are. It definitely isn't as easy as I assumed it would be, but actually gets more and more interesting the more I learn about it. More to come from this for sure.

  Wow! A lot has happened since the last time I updated this. I moved to DC a few months ago after taking a QA job with an aggregation email company. I initially applied for their sys admin
  job but ended up being talked in to QA. So far it's been great! I've been writing some selenium tests in Java which is ..ok, but I still have some room to write command line tools in Ruby to
  make some routine tasks a little easier. The highlight so far is getting
  %a{:href => "http://rundeck.org/", :target => "_blank"} Rundeck
  up and running to assist in building and rebuilding the various
  QA environments. Trying to tackle this one in my down time at work, but I've made a fair amount of progress. The only thing I have left to do is assign access policies.

  I graduated from VCU this month. What an amazing experience! I'm very excited to see where

%li
  A Twitter bot written in python. Currently the function is to search for the latest tweet with the hashtag '#zing' and retweet it. Using the Tweepy library, the Python-Twitter library doesn't appeal to me.

  A session handler writtin in PHP with MongoDB. During the last semester I wrote a session handler in PHP with MySQL and kind of regretted it. I now get the chance to write one for MongoDB which, in my opnion, should be faster and more felxible.

  After beating my head against the wall trying to get the SSH transfer job to work in Jenkins for a few weeks, the job is finally completing all steps and builds are stable!
  %br/
  %b Console output below:
%img{:alt => "jenkins success", :src => "images/console_success.jpg"}/
%p
  The journey from the previous errors I was getting and the first stable job was a long and winding one. The job is using the publish over SSH plugin. The build actively polls my GitHub repository frequently throughout the day.
  Whenever Jenkins notices a new push that has been made to the repository it triggers the build. Jenkins gathers all files from the repo and builds them in the workspace. After the build the SSH plugin sends all files on the
  workspace to my production server and then the files are live.
%hr
%h3 Hitting some road blocks!
%p I've been ending up stumped on getting Jenkins to actually transfer the files that have been changed after polling GitHub. I am getting everything else right; Build is successfull, SSH connection made, but then 0 files transfer. Here is output:
%br/
%img{:alt => "jenkins error", :src => "images/jenkins-error.jpg"}/
%p
  I'm considering a different method of deploying as well as wrapping my brain around the transfer set issue in Jenkins. After
  %b MUCH
  googling I see that others have the same issue as me and it could be a configuration issue with the way my project is set up. This isn't a huge problem since there are other tools that can fill its place. Currently looking in to
  %a{:href => "https://travis-ci.org/", :target => "_blank"} Travis-CI
  which seems to be tailor made for GitHub deployment and operates off git hooks.
%p
  Another issue raised here is that I'm about a week behind schedule. I can try making up the time but next week I need to attempt to stand up

%h3 Jenkins-CI Installation and configuration
%a{:href => "http://jenkins-ci.org/", :target => "_blank"}
  %img{:src => "images/jenkins.png"}/
%p
  Put the MongoDB work off for another week (it's actually not
  supposed to be started until later in the schedule but I was getting antsy
  to try figuring out the PHP funtions for it). This week I installed
  %a{:href => "http://jenkins-ci.org/a", :target => "_blank"} Jenkins Continuous Integration
  and have been working on a Build that will poll my
  %a{:href => "http://www.github.com/Whitepatrick", :target => "_blank"} GitHub
  every
  10 minutes and if any changes are made the build is supposed to be published to my production server. However in my
  experience nothing ever works the first time so I will keep plugging away.
%p
  %b Good signs from Jenkins:
  While monitoring all the logs, everything is working except the actual transfer of the files
  which is probably the most important step in the build process BUT at least all other processes are going off without
  a hitch. SSH connection is smooth, Jenkins is connecting to GitHub and getting polling accurately. I'm still not sure if the scheduler
  is working as it should but I can sort that detail out after I start getting consistant successful builds.

  to 20eyes.org unique infrastructure. After watching some of the logs
  while sending some DB traffic to the server I'm VERY excited about
  what I saw. Will have this problem fixed in the next day or so.
%p
  %b Update:
  Just got a script working that allows user to
  enter username and pw on main page and script enters that info in to
  mongodb collection. Next step is write script to authenticate user after
  information entry

  Now working on a feature for the site that will allow
  the user to create an account, upload an image, and submit a
  comment with the image. All managed by mongodb, scripted

%h3 Site Creation
%p Now creating all pages and setting up working links. By the end of tonight
(January 24th) I would like to have a bare bones site to accomodate
forthcoming content that will document my contiuous deployment project. Very
Excited!
